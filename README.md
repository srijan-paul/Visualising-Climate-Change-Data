# Visualising-Climate-Change-Data

## What is it ?
A page made with p5 and charts.js that lets you vizualize data that's the cause of  or related to climate change and global warming.
Currently it shows data about Population and Climate and you can choose to see it in bar, pie, line or doughnut charts.

Note that you have to run this on a local server on your PC to actually see it work :D

You can also compare the population growth rates between several countries.

Overall it's nothing fancy, just a small project that helped me learn the use of Charts.hs library. :D

## Screenshots.
Just to show you what it looks like :
